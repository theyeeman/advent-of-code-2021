Brainstorming

- get input as grid
    - 2d array of ints
- value greater than 9 means flash and increase surrounding cells by 1
- an octopus can only flash at most once per step
    - flashing means energy back to 0
- each step all energy increased by 1
    - so maybe increment all cells and then check for cells > 9, and if yes, set to 0 and increment all surrounding cells
    - need a way to mark cells that flash so they dont increment again
- since part 1 asks for 100 steps, part 2 probably asks for an even larger number of steps
- can't just loop through all cells consecutively since current cell could impact a previous cell
- have a stack that stores cells > 9, and pop from stack and increment cells around it, then if any of those go greater than 9, push to stack
    - also need a set to store cell that flashed so it doesn't increment when surrouding cells flashed
        - actually, if i set cell to 0 after flashing, then i can just check if adjacent cell is 0, if yes, do not increment

List of functins
- store input as 2d list
- increment all cells
- check grid for > 9 cells and store in stack
- keeping popping from stack and incrementing surrounding cells, and if surrounding cell > 9, add to stack
